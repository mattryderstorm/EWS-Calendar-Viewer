NAME
    EWS::Calendar::Viewer - Share your MS Exchange Calendar via a Web Page

VERSION
    This document refers to version 0.02 of EWS::Calendar::Viewer

SYNOPSIS
    I recommend you use something like App::BundleDeps to deploy this under
    a fastcgi server environment. Configure the application like so:

     privacy_level = limited
     start_of_week = 1
     
 <Model::EWSClient>
         <args>
             server   = myserver.example.com
             username = oliver
         </args>
     </Model::EWSClient>

    And then start the Catalyst applicaton, perhaps using one of the bundled
    server scripts.

CONFIGURTATION
  privacy_level
    This can be set to "public" to show only your free/busy status,
    "limited" to show the title of the event as well, or "private" to show
    all details of the event in a tooltip.

  start_of_week
    Set this to a number from 0 to 6 representing Sunday through to Saturday
    respectively.

  EWS Client
    You'll need to set the server fully qualified domain name, and username
    for the calendar's account. The password can be set in the file using
    the "password" option or via the environment variable "EWS_PASS".
